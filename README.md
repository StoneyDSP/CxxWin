BONUS: check '.vscode/tasks.json' for instructions on how to build on Windows with each of the <a href="https://www.msys2.org/docs/environments/">Msys64 subsystems</a>. Note that to build using the "MSYS2" sub-system from within VSCode, you must launch VSCode from the Msys64 MSYS2 environment command line. All of the others should build natively. All resulting '.exe' binaries run natively on Windows.

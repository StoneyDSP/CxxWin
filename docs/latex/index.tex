 Win32 API with C++ and Direct2D.

A quick one-\/and-\/done Win32 API project implementing a simple COM application window for Windows platforms in C++.



See \href{https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/learnwin32/introduction-to-windows-programming-in-c--}{\texttt{ the MSDN documentation for more}}.

BONUS\+: check \textquotesingle{}.vscode/tasks.\+json\textquotesingle{} for instructions on how to build on Windows with each of the \href{https://www.msys2.org/docs/environments/}{\texttt{ Msys64 subsystems}}. Note that to build using the \"{}\+MSYS2\"{} sub-\/system from within VSCode, you must launch VSCode from the Msys64 MSYS2 environment command line. All of the others should build natively. All resulting \textquotesingle{}.exe\textquotesingle{} binaries run natively on Windows.

BONUS 2\+: Includes additional source/header files for potential inclusion as Objective-\/C \textquotesingle{}modules\textquotesingle{}.
